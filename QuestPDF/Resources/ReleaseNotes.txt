- Added a `ScaleToFit` element - scales it child down so it does fit in the provided space,
- Added a `StopPaging` element - when its child requires more than one page to fully render, only the first page is shown,
- Added a 'LineVertical' and a 'LineHorizontal' elements - those will simplify your code a lot, no need to use the `Border` element anymore!
- Renaming: the `Stack` element has been renamed to the `Column` element,
- Renaming: children of the `Row` elements are not called `items` instead of `columns`, e.g. `ConstantItem`, `RelativeItem`, `AutoItem`,
- Added support of the `AutoItem` to the `Row` element - those items take as little width as possible,
- Improved default Fluent configuration behavior for elements: Scale, Padding, Translate,
- Improved integration support with the HttpContext.Response.Body. This improvement was introduced by schulz3000, thank you!
