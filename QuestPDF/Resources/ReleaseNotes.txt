- Improved library performance,
- Breaking change: changed default font from Calibri to an open-source Lato,
- Default font files are included with the nuget package, making it safe to deploy on any environment,
- Default font files are significantly smaller, so output document files should be smaller too (up to 20x reduction in size),
- When requested font is not available on the runtime environment, library provides list of available fonts,
- Fixed a rare layout overflow exception with the Inlined element,
- Fixed a memory leak connected to the HarfBuzz library.
