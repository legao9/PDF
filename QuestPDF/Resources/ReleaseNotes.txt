Introduced new element: `Table` - a great way to construct complex document structures, e.g. reports. This element covers all cases offered by combination of the `Stack` and the `Row` elements. Additionally, it provides support for more complex layouts and corner cases. Updating to the `Table` element can greatly simplify your code 😁

Other changes:
- Added new element `DefaultTextStyle` - it allows set new text style to all its children,
- Improved the default paging behavior for the `Row` element. In some minor corner cases it might cause infinite layout exceptions and confuse developers.
- Improved the `Row` element: added new type of column that combines constant and relative widths.
- Fixed default page sizes for: Letter and Legal.
