- Added new Inlined element - put block elements along a line with line-breaking and page-breaking support. This element also supports various element placement in the horizontal axis as well as the baseline. It will help me in future development, especially with text rendering optimization,

- Introduced a new SkipOnce element - it can be used to hide content on the first occurrence of the parent. Useful in conjunction with the ShowOnce element. This change was proposed by jcl86, thank you!

- Improved debugging experience by providing more detailed messages when the DocumentLayoutException is thrown. This improvement is based on the discussion started by preiius, thank you!

- Now it is possible to specify global, document-specific text style. This improves text style management and simplifies the typography pattern. This feature was proposed by JonnyBooker, thank you!

- Added two overloads to the Image element. Now, you can provide an image as a filePath or a Stream. This improvement was suggested by pha3z. Thank you!

- Improved text rendering performance.

- Improved documentation examples for the ShowOnce and the EnsureSpace elements.

- Improved text element: it does not throw an exception when an argument is null.

- All new releases of QuestPDF will contain symbol packages. Let's welcome simplified debugging experience 🎉

- 2021.11.4 - Fixed the Inlined element not rendering properly in some cases.
