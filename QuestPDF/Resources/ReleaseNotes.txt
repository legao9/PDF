Feature: implemented LetterSpacing property for the Text element
Improvement: the Text element API requires now to provide proper string 
Fix: the Alignment element incorrectly limits size of its child when only one axis is set (horizontal or vertical)
Maintenance: Updated SkiaSharp dependency to 2.88.3
