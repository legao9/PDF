### QuestPDF is an open-source .NET library for PDF documents generation. Utilizing several new patterns and practices, QuestPDF seeks to resolve the challenges inherent in this process.

üë®‚Äçüíª Design documents using C# and employ a code-only approach. Utilize your version control system to its fullest potential.

üß± Compose document with a range of powerful and predictable structural elements, such as text, image, border, table, and many more.

‚öôÔ∏è Utilize a comprehensive layout engine, specifically designed for document generation and paging support.

üìñ Write code using concise and easy-to-understand C# Fluent API. Utilize IntelliSense to quickly discover available options.

üîó Don't be limited to any proprietary scripting language or format. Follow your experience and leverage all modern C# features.

‚åõ Save time thanks to a hot-reload capability, allowing real-time document preview without code recompilation.

## Please share with the community

As an open-source project without funding, I cannot afford advertising QuestPDF in a typical way. Instead, the library relies on community interactions. Please consider sharing a post about QuestPDF and the value it provides. It really does help!
