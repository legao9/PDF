# What License Do You Need?

## General License Overview

Open-source projects are an important foundation for the software development ecosystem. Modern applications are depending more and more upon the work of enthusiast and experts. Open-source is not anymore just sharing knowledge and passion with everybody. Over last years, maintaining and developing those projects have became a highly responsible task.

We identify the importance of the QuestPDF library in your projects, and therefore want to make sure you can safely and confidently continue the development. We strongly believe that a dual-licensing model is the best solution for all users: providing the best development experience and feature set for everybody and every project, but also offering stability for every professional and enterprise product.

Being a healthy and growing community is our primary goal that motivates us to pursue professionalism.
