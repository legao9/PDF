Version 2023.5.0
- Simplified development loop by introducing cross-platform methods: GeneratePdfAndShow() and GenerateXpsAndShow()
- New shared image API: the ability to define a single image resource that is used in multiple places in the document without increasing its size
- New DocumentSettings API: target image raster DPI - now, the library automatically resizes all images to achieve desired DPI (dots-per-inch) resolution. It allows for minimizing output file size
- New DocumentSettings API: target image compression quality - the ability to specify the balance between size and quality for images in the document. It allows for minimizing output file size
- Refactoring: moved the PdfA setting from the DocumentMetadata class to the DocumentSettings class
- Improved Image API by providing additional FluentA API methods
- Improvement: the GenerateImage element now provides the expected image resolution, abstracting away the physical area size and target image DPI

Version 2023.5.1
- Adjusted and simplified the Image and SharedImage APIs,
- Improved image generation performance,
- Provided the ability to configure the image generation process: image format, compression quality and raster DPI.

Version 2023.5.2
- Adjusted accessibility of the Image API method.
